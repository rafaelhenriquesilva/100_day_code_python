Leap Year
๐ช This is a difficult challenge! ๐ช 

Write a program that returns True or False whether if a given year is a leap year.
A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year. 

- on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder

- except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder 

- unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder   

If English is not your first language, or if the above logic is confusing, try using this flow chart.

e.g. The year 2000: 

2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)  
2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)  
2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)  
So the year 2000 is a leap year. 

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because: 

2100 รท 4 = 525 (Leap)  
2100 รท 100 = 21 (Not Leap)  
2100 รท 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)  

Warning

Your return should be a boolean and match the Example Output format exactly, including spelling and punctuation.
